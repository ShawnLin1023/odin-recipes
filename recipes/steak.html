    <p>These Steak Fajitas are flavored with the best homemade seasoning and marinade! They’re served with sautéed onions and peppers, with endless add-on options including cheese, guacamole, salsa,  sour cream, and more!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs. skirt steak</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>1-2 tablespoons avocado oil</li>
        <li>2 bell peppers</li>
        <li>1 small red onion</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cover the steak with plastic wrap and use the textured side of a meat mallet to tenderize each side.</li>
        <li>Season each side with salt. I like to use a generous teaspoon of kosher salt per pound of steak.</li>
        <li>Combine the steak seasonings in a small bowl. Set 1 teaspoon of it aside and rub the rest over the entire surface of the steak.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet (preferably cast iron) over medium-high heat. Once nice and hot, add the steak.</li>
        <li>Slice the steak into thin strips. Be sure to do this against the grain- super important for tender bites of steak. Add it back to the skillet and toss to combine and heat through.</li>
    </ol>
